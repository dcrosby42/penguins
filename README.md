# Penguins

# Motivation

It's winter time again and it's been a while since i tried to animate a paralax snow field effect.

My youngest daughter has learned how to play keyboard-and-mouse driven games on a laptop. (Getting pretty darn good at controllering Minecraft.)

Quotes:

- "I wish there was a penguin game where you have to collect ALL the penguins."
- "Penguin tag!"

Thoughts
- Explore a top-down winterscape looking for other penguins. Type a "snap word" to rescue.  Rescued penguins follow you back to ___ (nest? cave? hangout area?) and stop following...
- 1:1 tag...? (needs clever ai)
- Snowball fight?
- Ice king cameo
- Thematic: Snowfall in bg / fg
- Thematic: Xmas wonderland theme -- snow, pine trees, decorations
- Find some nice wintery music
